        <p class="caption">Figure 1: Overview of the STAR-VAE (Left) and STAR-Gen (Right) framework. <strong>Left:</strong> The STAR-VAE encoder projects raw audio into a hierarchically organized latent space, explicitly sorting features by information density via the STAR regularization. <strong>Right:</strong> The generative model, STAR-Gen, represents a paradigm shift by adapting an LLM Decoder backbone for continuous flow matching. Unlike discrete autoregressive models, it utilizes the frozen STAR latents as continuous targets and predicts the vector field from noise, employing a hybrid attention mechanism to integrate text conditioning.</p>
